ac; Limos. We'll deliver Scotland to ya...we'll deliver that in 2014. So Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmon...Sammond?...I think his name is...Salmond...was interviewed by Jeremy Paxman. This was a very funny interview, because Jeremy Paxman is like, he's just like slamming the guy, just like, you know, you suck, this is stupid, are you out of your mind, you know...you're not realistic. And it's very funny how the guy answers him. We'll just play it until you're sick of it, but I think you'll be laughing the whole way through.
