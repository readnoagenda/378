ac; I got a note from one of our producers who lives there. A Scot who lives on the east coast of Scotland.  And he says the whole thing is a setup by the Scottish Nationalist Party, who really just want to take the North Sea oil platforms, join the EU and have a greater role in the EU.  He says a bunch of douche-bags, who just want to be a part of the big party there in Brussels.  And he says that most real Scot's don't want any part of this separation from the United Kingdom.
jd;  Yeah, well that's good news
