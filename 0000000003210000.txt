ac; Alright, so I'm prepping yesterday...we flew in...it's only like a four hour flight from Drone-aire to Houston, and then we had to drive from Houston to Austin. Actually, Miss Micky was very sweet: she drove almost the whole way so that I could kind of prep in the car and, you know, get ready. So we're in here, like 4 or 5 o'clock, and I'm prepping away, and of course I have all my channels on in the background. There was nothing on C-Span, so I flipped on CNN,
