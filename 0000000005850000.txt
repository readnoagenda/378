jd; "Greeting Citizens, thank you for the best podcast in the universe, multiverse, metaverse. Call it whatever you want. Advertising. I'm just wrapping up a long-running development project and just looking for a little karma to make doubly sure it all ends well. I would also like to put my godson, Zachary Schendle who will be turning five on the birthday for a list coming Sunday twenty ninth (29th January). His dad's birthday was last Friday but I didn't feel like he should be put on the list. Why? Because. Why? Because. Why? Because he, Nick Schendle, is a non-donating douchebag."
ac; Do I need to call him out?
jd; Yah!
