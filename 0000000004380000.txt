jd;...Ritalin is like this upper, this Intuniv stuff is like "in tune", you gotta "tune" the kid?
ac;Oh, "tweak".
jd;...is a downer!
ac;Oh, no!
jd;Yeah, so you give the kid Ritalin, and then he's like still not working right...
ac;[laughter]
jd;...you give him this stuff.
And the main thing is about it: it makes the kid stupid.
ac;[laughter]
jd;So, when I'm reading between the lines, and then they show this.
This commercial's pathetic, because they show this little kid, who's like, I dunno, eight (8)?
ac;Wait, is he playing piano, or doing his homework?
jd;No, he's at the table, he's at the dining room table.
ac;Like a zombie.
jd;He's being a really nice little kid.
He's like very quiet, like he's a Chinese kid in China or something.
ac;[laughter]
