jd;  That's half of the employable, it doesn't include ten [10] year olds
ac;  True, of the employable, but still.  It's just startling.  There's a report coming out, actually another one from the Lowlands.  Remember, the Lowlands did not get a downgrade.  But, people in the Lowlands are getting very, very angry.  There's a report coming out that our guy there, Geert Wilders commissioned to..they asked Lombard Street Research..they could all be in on the game with the nazi's, who knows.  This could all be a setup, but the report is..what would the economic consequence be of staying in the Euro Zone versus returning to the Gilder?  There's a report coming out in a couple days.  This will be a very important report because, of course, everyone is going to see that if they just go back to the gilder, they'll be richer.  They will have a lot more money to spend.
