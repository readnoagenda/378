ac; there was no coverage of it.  They snuck him out the back door.  They said they dropped him off somewhere in the woods.  And it was front page everywhere.  Everyone's talking about this.

This happens on the very day that Valterboss, former Finance Minister and Nalt Veleck, former president of the Dutch Central Bank, were questioned and had to admit..which was not covered, this is the distraction of the week over there..that when they nationalized ABN Amrow, Lazar Bank, who they hired to do the deal, misunderstood something in the valuation.  And the Dutch taxpayers overpaid for the bailout in the region of three [2] to fifteen [15] billion Euros.
