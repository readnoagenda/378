jd; small government, no wars, no taxes.  Everything.  Every checklist item that you would think would be a Republican item, as opposed to these other guys.  Let's face it, Romney..this is probably boring people overseas..but Romney and Gingrich and I would say Santorum are big government, lets get religion involved in the State, high taxes, acts of war.  Let's bomb Iran no matter what.  Something's wrong with this picture.
