jd;  If you want to play something end-of-show, I do have a couple of kind of funny stories about the history of the Glock gun.  But, we can save that
ac; Why don't you save that one.  Why don't we part with some Al Sharpton?
jd; You have Al Sharpton?  How long is it?  Should it be end-of-show or just now?
ac; Well, I think it's now because it's just funny to laugh about.  This is Al Sharpton playing the race card and he's got some douche-bag
