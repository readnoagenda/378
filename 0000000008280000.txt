ac;  And it wouldn't surprise me, if Germany and the Netherlands were playing together.  They're elites and even in the Dutch national anthem 'Oh Wilhelm is from [inaudible] am I of German blood?' is literally in the anthem.  This whole thing is a setup to just steal all of Europe.
jd;  I'm not going to argue against the idea
ac; I know you won't
jd; I've never been a big fan of this thing since it's inception
ac; Since they started in nineteen fifty six [1956] you were against it
jd; I was!
ac; [laughs] I just want to wind it up today.  I'm very worried for Congressman Paul.  In fact I'm going to give him a karma shot right now
jd; you've got karma
ac; I've heard some weird language before about gettin' rid of somebody.  But, Jack Welch, who uh, I guess Jack Welch is still seen as the, he ran General Electric for many, many..General Electric, right?
jd; Yeah
ac; For many, many years.
jd; He's very famous for as the CEO during his era.  Then, of course, when he got out he retired and gave the reins over to somebody else.  Basically, the board of directors, he didn't want a lot of money.  He wanted a bunch of perks, 'cause he was trying to keep his taxes low and he'd like the perks.  Including a jet.  As soon as he got ousted, they screwed him out of everything.  He basically lost his pension, the jet, fuck the jet, they want to take the jet back, and the guy's essentially borderline..you know considering how rich he should be..it's just getting by for him.
ac;  Do you think he really is not really rich?  He's gotta be loaded, the guy's gotta be loaded.
jd; No, I really think he's dead-sincere.  I don't think he's broke.  He's not broke like we are
ac; [laughs]
jd; He's not in a league he should be in
ac; So, he married, oh I don't know, his second or third wife, Susie
