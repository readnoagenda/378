ac; So of course the question is, why would Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya be disseminating all these falsified reports on Syria? 
And this is what you and I have been asserting for a while, is they're trying to take it down, just like Libya, we get all this phony-baloney video and the shaky cams on YouTube, and of course we can't put Pooper in there because it'd be too dangerous for him. 
We can't get any real reporting, so just show lots of YouTube videos and grainy video, and it's all like, "Ohh, he's killing his own people! You gotta get rid of him. He's killing 'em! Killing 'em! Killing 'em! Killing 'em! Whup 'im, whup 'im, whup 'im! Killing 'em! Killing his own people!"
