ac; You've pretty much described exactly what Micky wants -laughs- your insight is amazing.

ac; No, no, no no, no I don't know. Maybe we'll get married and we'll just have a party but then we'll ask everyone to get up and say something. That could be fun too. I always like the speeches the best.
jd; Yeah, it's not bad. I got it! We'll do a roast!
ac; Exactly. It's a roast. There you go. Perfect idea.
