ac; Anyway, it was so funny. After we concluded our broadcast on Thursday ....- It turns out we had about 250 kilobits per second, it was like using a modem. 
jd; That's what it sounded like too.
ac; Yeah I know. But we still got through it. But off course when you upload the file it takes like an hour and a half. So I'm sitting around waiting. And everyone in the house is like out on the boat and you know they are like, "hey, how you doing, how's that show going?". so by the time i am done, its 5, 5:30 local time and nothing left to do and the whole day is shot.
