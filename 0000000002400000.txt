you'll see that when he was inaugurated, he was wearing a red tie, and the second inauguration, the other Obama is wearing a blue tie.
jd; Well that could be the code!
ac; It's a code. It's the signal. So we have to be on the lookout.

ac; Is it red tie Obama or blue tie Obama? And then we have to figure out which one is evil.
jd; Well..
ac; [Laughs]
jd; Yeah, yeah, there could be three Obamas for all we know.
